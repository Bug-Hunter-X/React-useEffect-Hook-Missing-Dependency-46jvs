This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the `useEffect` hook.  The initial code causes an infinite loop because the `count` variable is not included in the dependency array, leading to the effect running on every render.  The solution shows how to correctly include `count` in the dependency array to fix the issue. The bug is demonstrated in `bug.js` and the solution is given in `bugSolution.js`.
